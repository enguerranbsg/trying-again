		<img src="images/gare-de-limoges.jfif" alt="Photo de gare"	class="img-cities">
		<li>This is a little town with a big charm ! Limoges is famous for its train station (the France's prettiest !) and for CSP, the best French basketball club in the history 🏀</li>
		<li>From my birth to my 15th year, I lived in a sensitive neighbourhood. It teached me to live in community far from clichés.</li>
		<li>In primary school, I discovered my two firsts passions : handball and drawing ! Psst... There is a hidden link when you click on the city name 😉</li>
		<li>When I went to middle school, I was one of the few person who came form a sensitive neighbourhhod. I suffered from racism and social discriminations. I gained confidence thanks to a travel I did in 2014 and this self-confidence stilled when I went to high school 📚</li>

		<li>This is a little town next to Paris, more precisely in Seine-Saint-Denis. This department always had a bad connotation but is appreciated for rap music. You can discover the man who create an album with all new rappers who come from this departement by clicking on the city's name !</li>
		<li>When I was in highschool I discover a new passion : make up 💄</li>
		<li>I was in high school in this city. This awarned me about issues lived by pupils in Priority Education Area (ZEP in French). Then I demonstrated many times with my teachers in order to denounce this situation ✊ </li>
		<li>My teachers always pushed me up because they knew that a profile as mine could change clichés about the department. Then I got BA with high honours and did a prepa class in Paris in order to integrate a business school 👩🏿‍💼</li>
